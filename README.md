# 15-puzzle-solver

This project implements an AI 15-puzzle solver using advanced search methodologies and sophisticated heuristics to efficiently solve the classic 15 puzzle game.

## Features

- Developed an AI 15-puzzle solver leveraging advanced search methodologies, including IDA* (Iterative Deepening A-star), IDS (Iterative Deepening Search), and BFS (Breadth-First Search).
- Employed sophisticated heuristics such as the Manhattan distance and misplaced tiles to guide the search algorithms towards efficient solutions.
- Demonstrated the capabilities of AI techniques in solving complex puzzles, showcasing the effectiveness of various search algorithms and heuristics.

## Usage

To run the program, input a string of the current state of the board and the type of heuristic method
To be used
